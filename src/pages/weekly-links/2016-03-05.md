**Top Links For 26/2-3/3:**

1.  A great article by Zach Holman about [how to deploy software](https://zachholman.com/posts/deploying-software). He gives some methods for ensuring the quality of the code before the deployment, explains some different types of deployments,  shows some tools that can be used during the deployment itself and describes some checks that need to be done after the deployment is over.
2.  Every developer is specialized with some programming languages. It is important to be familiar with the building blocks of the language. A living example on C# is the post of David Belmont about [building lambda expressions dynamically](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1079028/Build-Lambda-Expressions-Dynamically). Most of C# developers use lambda expressions on a daily basis, and this is a good opportunity to learn how it is constructed behind the scenes.
3.  All the developers which consider themselves serious, must stay updated and constantly learn new things. Karloine Klever gathers some [tools for improving your skills](http://www.karolikl.com/2016/02/upskilling-your-upskilling-skills-part2.html). This is actually the second part in her series of "upskilling your upskilling skills", and you can read the first article as well from the link above.
4.  Loose coupling is a basic concept in system design. It means that the components of the system should be independent of each other as much as possible. In the following article of Peter Vogel, he explains this concept and [give ideas how to make code more loosely coupled](https://visualstudiomagazine.com/blogs/tool-tracker/2015/12/loosely-coupled-code.aspx).
5.  Here are some [leadership tips](https://dzone.com/articles/7-leadership-lessons-from-a-first-time-manager) from Andy Hurd, which are based from his experience as a first-time manager. I agree with most of his ideas. I think that his point of "being prompt with difficult conversations" is extremely important. When we identify a problem, we should handle it as early as we can and not to avoid from doing this and let it grow.
6.  Abstraction is a key concept in object-oriented programming. We use it in a lot of problems, while there are cases when [abstraction can be harmful](https://dzone.com/articles/abstraction-considered-harmful), as this article, which is written by Tyler Treat, suggests. It is important to be aware of the weaknesses of abstraction, and yes, something violation of DRY(Don't Repeat Yourself) is preferred to forcing of  not suitable abstraction.
7.  So after Microsoft acquired Xamarin, it is really a good time to know [what is Xamarin](http://codingjourneyman.com/2016/03/01/what-is-xamarin/), in this informative post of Julien Fiaffé.
