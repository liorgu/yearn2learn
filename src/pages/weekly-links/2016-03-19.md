**Top Links For 11-17/3:**

1.  A very common case for developers is to become involved with code of other developers. Here is a detailed article which brings an [example of diving into others code](http://www.lihaoyi.com/post/DivingIntoOtherPeoplesCode.html). Li Haoyi shows all the process with a project from GitHub - from getting overview about the project and install it on your local machine, up to getting familiar with the code, in stages.
2.  Many of us probably wrote sometimes a function which can return null and a calling function from other class which handles this null. This is an example for a strong coupling between the two classes. The following post by John Hilton, displays the ["Tell Don't Ask" principle](http://jonhilton.net/2016/03/14/apply-tell-dont-ask-and-reduce-coupling/), which helps to avoid such cases.
3.  In a previous workplace, I worked on a gigantic project, with a lot of features, and a lot of user types, which use different features. It was very challenging to design the UI in a way which fits everyone, and to teach the users about the software. This post offers some techniques for [reducing feature bloat in your product](https://dzone.com/articles/feature-bloat-the-silent-epidemic).
4.  You use the same developer tools (IDE, build, production...) for a long time and you are sure that you are expert of it. All of a sudden you get a tip from a colleague which makes your life easier, and you understand that you don't know all the stuff about your tools. This article by Steven Van Bael, suggests a basic but important idea - to [constantly learn about your software](https://www.stevenvanbael.com/2016/03/17/read-about-the-software-you-use/).
5.  Are you have a complex code and you want to observe the routes of your executed code? This post of Peter Vogel offers a solution for it with a [state path object](https://visualstudiomagazine.com/articles/2016/03/01/keep-track-of-what-your-code-really-did.aspx), which gathers the different states during the execution.
6.  In the following article,  Martin Fowler gives his insights  about [code refactoring](https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/debunking-5-refactoring-misconceptions), in reference to the Agile methodology.
7.  Erik Dietrich continues his sequence of valuable posts, by writing about [metrics for measuring your code](http://www.daedtech.com/important-code-metrics-youve-never-heard/). And not, the number of lines is not a good criteria :)
8.  Two interesting survey results were published this week: the first one is [the annual developer survey of Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2016), and the second one is a comprehensive [CSS survey](http://www.sitepoint.com/results-ultimate-css-survey/), conducted by SitePoint.
