**Top 20 Links For 3-9/2** On this 50th edition of weekly links, there are 2 inspiring stories about creative projects -  one about analyzing Trump's tweets in order to find out companies we should invest in, and the second  sends you an email when you need to take an umbrella with you .  In addition, there are many useful React articles about reuse, testing, React Native and reconciliation. Also, there are 2 posts about VS Code which is a cool editor which I try out now.
