1. [The Elements of UI Engineering](https://overreacted.io/the-elements-of-ui-engineering/)  
   **Dan Abramov**  
    Front-End engineering is harder than it may seem. Dan brings up important issues which we may not be aware of during development. I hope that he or someone else will publish a post with recommended patterns for tackling each issue.
2. [React Hooks: Array Destructuring Fundamentals](https://blog.kentcdodds.com/react-hooks-array-destructuring-fundamentals-952fbfd57ea)  
   **Kent C. Dodds**  
   With the upcoming hooks feature in React, array destructuring is drawing more attention. Kent shows how to learn about this syntax, while mentioning great resources on the way: [AST Explorer](https://astexplorer.net/), [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web) and [Online Babel REPL](https://babeljs.io/repl/)
3. [Gradient Borders in CSS](https://css-tricks.com/gradient-borders-in-css/)

   Chris writes about how to make gradient borders and uses border-image property, which I have never heard before.
4. [Pass props to React Router's Link component](https://tylermcginnis.com/react-router-pass-props-to-link/)  
   **Tyler McGinnis**  
   Tyler mentions 2 options when sending the "to" prop to the Link component of React-Router: It can be a string and just contain the path, and it can be an object with "pathname" and "state" keys, which is useful and less known option.
5. [How to learn React.js in 2019](https://www.robinwieruch.de/learn-react-js/)  
   **Robin Wieruch**  
   Robin writes about his approach to learn React. He advises to learn only vanilla JavaScript and React, with no other confusing libraries on the way. He suggests to read the documentation from [React Site](https://reactjs.org/) and shares links from his own blog.
6. [9 Tips and Tricks for Chrome Dev Tools](https://dev.to/lssweatherhead/9-tips-and-tricks-for-chrome-dev-tools-149c)  
   **Laura Weatherhead**  
   Laura shares some tips for using Chrome dev tools. I was familiar with most of the points, but it was great to discover the "stop" button which can salvage from infinite loops.
7. [How To Learn CSS](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/01/how-to-learn-css/)  
   **Rachel Andrew**  
   Rachel, one of the most influential people in the CSS community, suggests how to learn CSS. She advises to learn about the fundamentals of CSS rather than its properties and values. She divides the fundamentals into sections, and gives some introduction and references for each section.
8. [Improve React Performance using Lazy Loading and Suspense](https://blog.bitsrc.io/improve-react-performance-using-lazy-loading-and-suspense-933903171954)  
   **Chidume Nnamdi**  
   During the last year, React published releases with a lot of new features. Chidume explains how to use lazy loading and Suspense , which were published on React 16.6. He explains their syntax and usage, and gives some basic use-case of lazy loading of components which are rendered conditionally according to the current route.
9. [Effective Mental Models for Code and Systems](https://medium.com/@copyconstruct/effective-mental-models-for-code-and-systems-7c55918f1b3e)  
    **Cindy Sridharan**  
   We should write code that will be easy to understand and maintain, but everyone has a different mental model, so how we can achieve it? Cindy believes that self-documenting code is a myth and explains what our documentation should include - comments, code examples, assumptions and dependencies are just a part of it.
10. [Monorepos: Please don’t!](https://medium.com/@mattklein123/monorepos-please-dont-e9a279be011b) and [Monorepo: please do!](https://medium.com/@adamhjk/monorepo-please-do-3657e08a4b70)  
    **Matt Klein** and **Adam Jacob**  
    Matt wrote an article about the negatives of monorepos and Adam wrote a response which claims the opposite. They both bring up valid points. As Matt wrote, when you work on a project inside a monorepo, it slows down your day-2-day development because every action takes more time. However, as Adam wrote, when you have a common code which is shared in multiple repositories, and you change its api, it is more convenient to apply the change in a monorepo, than on each separate repository. I was more convinced by Matt because his arguments are broader.
