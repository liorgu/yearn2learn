**Top 10 Links For 4-10/1**

1. [New year, new GitHub: Announcing unlimited free private repos and unified Enterprise offering](https://blog.github.com/2019-01-07-new-year-new-github/)  
   **Nat Friedman**  
   In the last few months, there are a lot of new features and changes in GitHub. This time, they had a big announcement where they moved private repositories to the free plan. This move will attract many people that the primary reason for not choosing GitHub was the fact that making a repository private would cost money.
2. [React UI Kits](https://dev.to/kayis/react-ui-kits-3fm2)  
   **Kay Plößer**  
   Kay gives a comprehensive list of collections of React components. You can use it when choosing a ui toolkit to your next project, and also for learning from others code, which I believe it is extremely important.
3. [git reset --explain](https://dev.to/konrad_126/git-reset---explain-49bl)  
   **Zvonimir Spajic**  
   Git reset is considered a scary command. Zvonimir explains in clear words how each of the Git reset commands(soft/mixed/hard), affects the 3 git trees(working directory, staging area and the repository).
4. [Bindings and Lexical Scope in Ruby](https://blog.appsignal.com/2019/01/08/ruby-magic-bindings-and-lexical-scope.html)  
   **Jeff Kreeftmeijer**  
   Binding is a term which describes the connection between a name to a place in the memory which it represents. Jeff writes about how bindings and scopes works in Ruby.
5. [A Beginner’s Guide to GraphQL](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/a-beginners-guide-to-graphql-86f849ce1bec)  
    **Leonardo Maldonado**  
   GraphQL is a trending query language, and in my opinion it is justified. I am using GraphQL for building this blog and I enjoy it. One of the best advantages of GraphQL, is that the when the client wants to fetch data, it asks for specific fields and get exactly them. Leonardo gives a great introduction to GraphQL and a motivation to use it.
6. [9 Tricks for Kickass JavaScript Developers in 2019](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/9-tricks-for-kickass-javascript-developers-in-2019-eb01dd3def2a)  
   **Lukas Gisder-Dubé**  
   Lukas gives an overview of some features in modern JavaScript. Nothing revolutionary here, but tips for beginner web developers to write clean code in JavaScript.
7. [Sass Techniques from the Trenches](https://css-tricks.com/sass-techniques-from-the-trenches/)  
   **Buddy Reno**  
   Buddy writes an extended guide to Sass. He explains the capabilities of the language and gives some use cases when they should be used. I believe that we should use more of the advanced features, which organize the code in a logical form.
8. [How to Make Things High-Quality](https://medium.com/@joulee/how-to-make-things-high-quality-f466f875227d)  
   **Julie Zhuo**  
   There is always a tension between delivering features on time and writing a perfect code. Julie gives it an acronym, TTBQT(The tradeoff Between Quality and Time) and offers a way to solve this conflict.
9. [The React Handbook](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/the-react-handbook-b71c27b0a795)  
   **Flavio Copes**  
   When you learn React, it is not just about its syntax and life cycle. You need to know also modern JavaScript, React concepts, styling, tools and more. Flavio gives all of that in an one giant tutorial.
10. [Here are some super secret VS Code hacks to boost your productivity](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/here-are-some-super-secret-vs-code-hacks-to-boost-your-productivity-20d30197ac76) and [VS Code: Now creating pull requests](https://blog.github.com/2019-01-07-create-pull-requests-in-vscode/)  
    **Dylan Tientcheu** and **Meaghan Lewis**  
    VS Code is my favorite text editor. Choosing a text editor is crucial because at the end of the day, this is the tool which you use most of the time. One of the things which I love in VS Code, is its progress. These 2 articles emphasize it. Dylan shares features and extensions of the editor which improve productivity. Meaghan writes about the GitHub pull requests extension. I am using this extension and I highly recommend it. It is very convenient to create and read pull requests without losing our focus from the editor.
