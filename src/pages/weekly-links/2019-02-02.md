1. [What is tree shaking and how does it work?](https://bitsofco.de/what-is-tree-shaking/)  
    **Ire Aderinokun**  
   When you are making a named import in your JavaScript, you may expect that you import only the specific function that you want. This is not the case. Ire explains about tree shaking, which intends to solve this problem in the majority of times.
2. [Ruby tricks for junior developers](https://drivy.engineering/ruby-tricks-for-junior-devs/)  
    **Clement Bruno**  
   It is always nice to read about some sugar syntax in a language and in this article Clement mentions a few of them in Ruby. It is intended for juniors but even more experienced developers can learn from it. I found out about the safe navigation operator which is really neat.

   TypeScript is growing fast those days, and we see lately a lot of popular web developers which migrate their projects into TypeScript. Here is a different opinion, from Eric Elliott, which is also a well-respected professional, which recommends to not pick TypeScript for large-scale projects.
5. [How To Be Successful](http://blog.samaltman.com/how-to-be-successful)  
   **Sam Altman**  
    Sam gives some tips for entrepreneurs. I usually don't share this kind of articles because success is very subjective. However, in this case, I think that almost everyone can connect to some of the points in the article, and also the references to other articles in [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18992914) are very interesting.
6. [A Year of Utility Classes](https://css-irl.info/a-year-of-utility-classes/)  
    **Michelle Barker**  
   Utility classes are css classes which are specific to one definition. [TailWindCss](https://github.com/tailwindcss/tailwindcss) is a popular library for using utility classes. Michelle gives some pros and cons for using it from her own experience.
7. [How to free up space on your developer Mac](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-free-up-space-on-your-developer-mac-f542f66ddfb)  
    **Gant Laborde**  
   For developers which use Mac, here are some great tips from Gant how to clean your Mac. If you use Git / JavaScript / Ruby / Docker, those tips are intended for you. I am excited to try it next week and check how much space I saved.
8. [CSS Position Sticky - How It Really Works!](https://medium.com/@elad/css-position-sticky-how-it-really-works-54cd01dc2d46)  
    **Elad Shechter**  
   Sticky is a relatively new option for css position attribute, for making elements to stick their position when scrolling. Elad gives a deep dive to this definition and how it works. Just remember that IE doesn't support it, although there are polyfills.
9. [42 performance tips for Ruby on Rails](https://www.mskog.com/posts/42-performance-tips-for-ruby-on-rails/)

10. [Firefox 65: WebP support, Flexbox Inspector, new tooling & platform updates](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/01/firefox-65-webp-flexbox-inspector-new-tooling/) and [What's New In DevTools (Chrome 73)](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2019/01/devtools)  
    **Chris Mills, Dan Callahan** and **Kayce Basques**  
    While Chrome is by far the most used browser, with excellent developer tools, there is a constant competition from Firefox, especially during the last year. In the last version, Firefox ships the CSS Flexbox Inspector(which joins the existing CSS Grid inspector), and also a changes panel where you can see the changes you made in the rules panel during the current session. Chrome developers tools also don't keep quiet. They are going to release a version with a new LogPoints feature, which is similar to breakpoints, just log into the console instead of suspend the execution of the code. Also tooltips during inspect, and navigating the console with the keyboard are among the most anticipated features.
