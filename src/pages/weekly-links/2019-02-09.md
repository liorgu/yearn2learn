   **Wojciech Ogrodowczyk**

8. [Unraveling Classes, Instances and Metaclasses in Ruby](https://blog.appsignal.com/2019/02/05/ruby-magic-classes-instances-and-metaclasses.htm)

    **Brad Frost**  
    There is a debate if the files of React components should be called "index.js" or to include the name of the component, or to have both. Brad writes the advantages and disadvantages for each strategy. He currently use the strategy of using both, which its main drawback is the amount of files. He suggests that no matter what you choose in your company, you should be consistent.
