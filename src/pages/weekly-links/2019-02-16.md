**Top 10 Links For 8-14/2**

1. [Introducing draft pull requests](https://github.blog/2019-02-14-introducing-draft-pull-requests/)  
   **Luke Hefson**  
   GitHub released a new feature - draft pull requests. With draft pull requests, you can create pull requests when your code is not ready for an official pull request, and you just want to share or upload it. It disables the possibility of merging it and code owners won't get notifications about this pull request while it is on draft state.
2. [What’s coming to Rails 6.0?](https://medium.com/rubyinside/whats-coming-to-rails-6-0-8ec79eea66da)  
   **Guy Maliar**  
   Rails 6 expected to be released by the end of April. In the meantime, Guy gives a great brief about the prominent new features and API's of this version. I especially liked the Relation#pick method, implicit order column configuration, and parallel testing.
3. [Make it Boring](https://jeremy.codes/blog/make-it-boring/)  
   **Jeremy Wagner**  
   If the site is conventional and sort of "boring", it is more convenient for the user. This is the message that Jeremy tries to express in his post. I take it to the development field, and think that when the code is more structured, and doesn't try to be smart, it is more readable.
4. [The Smart Ways to Correct Mistakes in Git](https://css-tricks.com/the-smart-ways-to-correct-mistakes-in-git/)  
   **Tobias Günther**  
   Tobias shows how to handle common scenarios in git - fixing the last commit, undoing local changes and more. I always refer the great site [Oh Shit, Git!](http://ohshitgit.com/) when I have a kind of emergency situation on Git.
5. [5 Steps for Disagreeing Effectively](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/5-steps-disagreeing-effectively-julie-zhuo/)  
   **Julie Zhuo**  
   Managing a disagreement can be complicated. Julie suggests a process for constructive disagreement. First, check your reasons for the disagreement, and maybe consult with other people you trust. Then consider the pros and cons of all the options. Maybe the assumptions of you and your colleague are different. Then, when everything is clear and there is still a disagreement, this is a good time for escalation.
6. [I built my own css curriculum to master it](https://dev.to/imm9o/i-built-my-own-css-curriculum-to-master-it-2ec2)  
   **Islam Muhammad**  
   Islam represents his method for learning css. He divides all the things to learn into subjects, and brings good references for each subject. You can find more resources and collections of resources in [my blog](https://yearn2learn.netlify.com/resources/css).
7. [Be Careful Assigning to has_one Relations](https://andycroll.com/ruby/be-careful-assigning-to-has-one-relations/)  
   **Andy Croll**  
   In Rails, there is a pitfall when using the has_one relation and use the setter method - `modelInstance.associationName`. Every time this method is called, a new object is inserted to the database, and the previous one wasn't deleted(prior to the fix on 5.2 version). Andy shows his solution for it, explains it and even brings up a few alternatives.
8. [useReducer, don't useState](https://matthamlin.me/blog/2019/february/why-you-should-useReducer/) and [Should I useState or useReducer?](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/should-i-usestate-or-usereducer)  
   **Matt Hamlin and Kent C. Dodds**  
   useState and useReducer are two React hooks which enables to get/set data from/to the state of the component. Matt writes about the advantages of useReducer over useState and Kent relates to Matt's article and explains why he used useState in the redesign of his [website](https://kentcdodds.com/).
9. [Quick! What’s the Difference Between Flexbox and Grid?](https://css-tricks.com/quick-whats-the-difference-between-flexbox-and-grid/) and [To Grid or to Flex?](https://css-irl.info/to-grid-or-to-flex/)  
   **Chris Coyier** and **Michelle Barker**  
   Chris opened a [thread in Twitter](https://twitter.com/chriscoyier/status/1088827201468813312) about the explanation about the differences between CSS Flexbox and CSS Grid. He and Michelle bring answers from this thread and try to compare the two layouts in two different articles.
10. [Preloading Fonts and the Puzzle of Priorities](https://andydavies.me/blog/2019/02/12/preloading-fonts-and-the-puzzle-of-priorities/) and [Resource Prioritization – Getting the Browser to Help You](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/resource-prioritization)  
    **Andy Davies** and **Sérgio Gomes**  
    In our web application, we have resources that the browser needs to download. Andy and Sérgio shows us how we can define priorities for improving the performance of our site. Andy wrote a deep dive on using `<link rel=preload>` for loading of fonts. Sérgio shows other options as `<link rel="preconnect">` and `<link rel="prefetch">` and suggests use cases for each one.
