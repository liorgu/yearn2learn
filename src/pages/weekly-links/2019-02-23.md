**Top 10 Links For 15-21/2**

1. [Disallow large imports from JavaScript projects](https://addyosmani.com/blog/disallow-imports/)  
    **Addy Osmani**  
   Addy gives a great tip: using [no-restricted-imports](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-restricted-imports) rule of ESLint. I think about using this rule for preventing programmers from importing methods for lodash that has equivalent methods in native JavaScript like `map` and `reduce`, and maybe it can be used also for preventing the import of the whole lodash library by mistake.
2. [React Hooks: Compound Components](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/compound-components-with-react-hooks)  
    **Kent C. Dodds**  
   Compound component is an advanced pattern in React. Hooks are the new hot React API. Kent explains about the need of compound components and shows an example of implementation of toggle component as a compound component with hooks.
3. [Why I Write CSS in JavaScript](https://mxstbr.com/thoughts/css-in-js/)  
    **Max Stoiber**  
   Max is the creator of the popular [Styled-Components](https://www.styled-components.com/), which is CSS-in-JS library. In this post, Max tries to show the benefits of CSS-in-JS over other options. I previously tried it and had some difficulties, but maybe it is the right time to try again.
4. [The future of JavaScript state management is less state management…](https://medium.com/@amcdnl/the-future-of-javascript-state-management-is-less-state-management-ba1d97b99308)  
    **Austin McDaniel**  
   There is a growing debate about why and when to use state management libraries. Austin, which wrote a state management library for Angular, suggests that in most cases, we don't need to use a state management library. He relates to React and Redux, and argues that Redux is often over-engineering because all of the boilerplate it requires, and we can use React's context instead.
5. [Fancy new selectors within groups can break your CSS rule](https://catalin.red/fancy-new-selectors-can-break-your-css-rule/)  
    **Catalin Rosu**  
   If you have a group of CSS selectors, and one of them is invalid, it will break all the selectors in the group. Catalin was experienced with it and this is a great example for making a mistake, learning from it and sharing the knowledge with others.
6. [Progressive React](https://houssein.me/progressive-react)  
   **Houssein Djirdeh**  
   Performance is one of the important aspects in programming. In this informative article, Houssein shows us how we can measure the performance of our React application, and what can be done for improving it.
7. [The struggles of a software developer outside of the code](https://enmascript.com/articles/2019/02/21/the-struggles-of-a-software-engineer-outside-of-the-code-editor)  
   **Enmanuel Durán**  
   Enmanuel points out some situations in a life of a developer, and what is best to do in those situations: When your ideas are not being listened, when you are asked about something you are not sure about, and more.
8. [Yeah hooks are good, but have you tried faster React Components?](https://medium.com/@siffogh3/yeah-hooks-are-good-but-have-you-tried-faster-react-components-e698a8db468c)  
   **Seif Ghezala**  
   Hooks are great but they are not the solution to all your problems in your React application. Seif explains about the render phase and offers some tips on how to consume on render calls.
9. [Rails 6 unnoticed features](https://drivy.engineering/rails-6-unnoticed-features/)  
    **Alexandre Ferraille**  
   One more article about the new features on Rails 6. This time Alexandre mentions some of the minor new features, which can have a great influence on your code and app.
10. [I ruin developers’ lives with my code reviews and I'm sorry](https://habr.com/en/post/440736/)  
    **Philipp Ranzhin**  
    In one of the most honest posts I have ever read, Philipp admits bulling his coworkers during pull requests. For me, one of the most important goals of the pull request is learning - I learn from code that someone else wrote and the person learns from my comments. We should treat each other kindly, and not to put the pull request phase as something to afraid of.
