**Top 10 Links For 8-14/3**

1. [A Complete Guide to useEffect](https://overreacted.io/a-complete-guide-to-useeffect/)  
   **Dan Abramov**  
   A great deep-dive of Dan into the useEffect hook. Even though the article is long, I recommend reading the whole of it. When I read the TLDR part, I felt a little confused, but everything became clear when I kept reading. I believe it is important to understand the mental model of the framework you use and it is a good investment.
2. [Designing An Aspect Ratio Unit For CSS](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/03/aspect-ratio-unit-css/)  
   **Rachel Andrew**  
   In the last CSS Working Group meeting, there was an agreement about a new CSS property - aspect-ratio. This property will be used in order to determine the proportion between the width and height of a box. In this article, Rachel describes what are the current solutions, what will be the behavior of the new property, and how we can influence it.
3. [Removing duplicate objects from an Array (is hard)](https://bitsofco.de/removing-duplicate-objects-from-an-array-is-hard/)  
   **Ire Aderinokun**  
   Remove duplicates from an array by shallow equal is easy - either by `Array.filter` or `new Set()`. But what if you have an array of objects, that you want to compare deeply? Ire gives her own solution, with a couple of cool optimizations on the way. Just be aware that this solution [doesn't work on nested objects](https://twitter.com/LGutweter/status/1106901636537114625), and there are alternatives like `lodash/uniqBy` and `JSON.stringify`.
4. [Give Me Back My Monolith](http://www.craigkerstiens.com/2019/03/13/give-me-back-my-monolith/)  
   **Craig Kerstiens**  
   Microservice architecture is getting a lot of hype during recent years. It always good to know the drawbacks of it, and Craig mentions a few of them in this article.
5. [Don't use instance variables in partials](https://andycroll.com/ruby/dont-use-instance-variables-in-partials/)  
   **Andy Croll**  
   Andy recommends to not use instance variables in partial views in Rails. The reason for it is that at first, the partial is used in one use-case where the instance variable exists, but when the application will grow, this instance variable won't be available when this partial will be used from a different path.
6. [How to convince your team to adopt CSS Grid](https://css-irl.info/how-to-convince-your-team-to-adopt-grid/)  
   **Michelle Barker**  
   CSS Grid is a powerful layout that has some limitations as a relatively new API. Michelle suggests how to convince your team to use it. The ideas from the last paragraph can be used on a broader scope.
7. [Roll Your Own Analytics](https://www.pcmaffey.com/roll-your-own-analytics)  
   **PC Maffey**  
   Google Analytics is a great analytics provider, which I use on my website. However, I like to see people who build their own implementation according to their needs. Here is a detailed report of how to create an analytics engine by yourself, using React, Netlify and Google App Scripts.
8. [3 Topics in 1 JavaScript Interview Question](https://dev.to/maciekchmura/3-topics-in-1-javascript-interview-question-1gd7)  
   **Maciek Chmura**  
   Maciek gives a JavaScript interview question that checks knowledge of JavaScript in a couple of areas. He explains the fundamentals that we have to understand in order to solve this question and explains the answer. I recommend a lot to watch the talk about the [Event Loop](https://youtu.be/8aGhZQkoFbQ), which is embedded in this article.
9. [Why you shouldn't use Moment.js...](https://inventi.studio/en/blog/why-you-shouldnt-use-moment-js)  
   **InventiStudio**  
   Moment.js is the most popular JavaScript library for handling dates. This post mentions some issues on this library - performance, size and more, and suggests other libraries as a replacement.
10. [React Hooks — The Most Performant Way to Write React](https://blog.usejournal.com/react-hooks-the-most-performant-way-to-write-react-393e135e1cc)  
    **Ryan Carniato**  
    The new React hooks API is cool, but what about its performance? There were some suspicions that it is slower. This article represents a performance test that was conducted by [a respected library](https://github.com/krausest/js-framework-benchmark). The title is a little misleading because the hook version didn't win all the tests, but it does show that its results are strong enough, so this shouldn't be against it when you decide to use it or not. Beyond that, I believe that the performance of hooks will just get better in future React versions.
