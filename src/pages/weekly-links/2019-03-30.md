**Top 10 Links For 22-28/3**

1. [The State Reducer Pattern with React Hooks](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/the-state-reducer-pattern-with-react-hooks)  
   **Kent C. Dodds**  
   A year ago, Kent represented the [state reducer pattern](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/the-state-reducer-pattern). This pattern enables inversion of control, controlling a state of an inner component from an outer component, using render props. Now, when we have React hooks, Kent shows how to use this pattern with hooks instead of render props.
2. [How To Align Things In CSS](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/03/css-alignment/)  
   **Rachel Andrew**  
   Rachel represents methods for aligning in CSS. It divides aligning to 2 categories: aligning of inline elements and aligning of box elements. In the first category, we have `text-align`, `vertical-align` and `line-height` for the rescue, while with box elements we have properties of Flexbox and Grid layouts like `justify-content`, `align-items` and more. She explains when to use each property, when it doesn't work and how to overcome it.
3. [A Guide to CSS counter](https://dev.to/samanthaming/a-guide-to-css-counter-3aaa)  
   **Samantha Ming**  
    Did you know that CSS has properties that support counting? Me either. Samantha discovers us the world of CSS Counters, which can be pretty useful, and it is supported by all major browsers.
4. [Localhost isn't local anymore](https://dev.to/lostintangent/localhost-isnt-local-anymore-2ib6)  
   **Jonathan Carter**  
   One of my favorite extensions of Visual Studio Code is [Visual Studio Live Share](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/services/live-share/). This post of Jonathan focuses on sharing servers functionality. You can share one of your ports with others, so they can see, play. and debug the current state of your project.
5. [Cool uses of the ::before and ::after pseudoelements](https://zendev.com/2019/03/28/cool-uses-of-before-after-pseudoelements.html)  
    **Kevin Ball**  
   The `::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements may be useful in a lot of scenarios. Kevin explains their role and gives some simple and advanced examples for using them.
6. [How to Avoid the “Boolean Trap” When Designing React Components](https://spicefactory.co/blog/2019/03/26/how-to-avoid-the-boolean-trap-when-designing-react-components/)  
   **Filip Danić**  
   Using a lot of boolean props on your React component is an anti-pattern, especially if there is a relation between them. Filip discusses this issue and suggests some solutions like using enum props and dispatching actions.
7. [Stop using so many divs! An intro to semantic HTML](https://dev.to/kenbellows/stop-using-so-many-divs-an-intro-to-semantic-html-3i9i)  
   **Ken Bellows**  
   You can use only div elements for block elements. It will work, but it is wrong semantically. Ken explains the reasons for that and suggests replacements from the HTML5 specification.
8. [Writing Your Own Custom Hooks!](https://blog.bitsrc.io/writing-your-own-custom-hooks-4fbcf77e112e)  
   **Aayush Jaiswal**  
   Custom hooks are the shiniest tool for reusing the same logic in different React components. Aayush shows some cool examples for custom hooks. I also recommend looking on [use hooks website](https://usehooks.com/) which contains a lot of examples of custom hooks which you can use in your projects.
9. [The shortest way to conditional insert properties into an object literal](https://dev.to/jfet97/the-shortest-way-to-conditional-insert-properties-into-an-object-literal-4ag7)  
   **Andrea Simone Costa**  
   Did you have a situation when you creating a JSON, but one of the keys should be included/excluded based on the condition? How did you handle it? Andrea represents a cool trick for doing it on one line during the object creation.
10. [React Hooks: Migration from Class to Function Components](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-hooks-migration/) and [Practical React Hooks: How to refactor your app to use Hooks](https://blog.logrocket.com/practical-react-hooks-how-to-refactor-your-app-to-use-hooks-b1867e7b0a53)  
    **Robin Wieruch** and **Ohans Emmanuel**  
    One of the ways to experiment with the new React Hooks API is with refactoring existing class components. It should be easier, because you already have the logic and the design, and you need to make just a few adjustments for moving to the Hooks API. Robin and Ohans wrote 2 different tutorials for refactoring a class component into a functional component. I have to add that there is no school answer for this migration. You shouldn't act like a robot and replace all `setState` calls with `useState`. You should look at the component from a broader point of view and [choose the right hooks for the job](https://yearn2learn.netlify.com/dilemmas-with-react-hooks-1). Maybe you even solve some unknown issues in your existing component.
