**Top 10 Links For 29/3-4/4**

1. [AHA Programming](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/aha-programming)  
   **Kent C. Dodds**  
   DRY(Don't Repeat Yourself) is a popular programming principle. However, a wrong abstraction can be more painful than a duplicate code. Kent discusses it and suggests to wait until we are sure we came up with the right abstraction.
2. [Ruby's Creed](https://metaredux.com/posts/2019/04/02/ruby-s-creed.html)  
   **Bozhidar Batsov**  
   Every programming language has its own specialty. Ruby is known as a language that makes an effort to make its users happy. Ruby 2.7 is going to ship a new feature, [numbered parameters](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/4475). Bozhidar argues that although it makes the code shorter, it will become less readable thus contradicts Ruby's nature.

8. [All you need to know to understand JavaScript’s Prototype](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/all-you-need-to-know-to-understand-javascripts-prototype-a2bff2d28f03)  
   **Shirshendu Bhowmick**  
   Prototype is a fundamental topic in JavaScript, but many programmers don't know much about it because it is not a must for creating a working application. Many articles were written about it, but I think that this article of Shirshendu is one of the best.

   **Abhay Nikam**  
   This short post of Abhay is about a new API on the upcoming Rails 6: `ActiveRecord::Relation#reselect`. When I read it, I was surprised to find out some existing APIs, [rewhere](https://apidock.com/rails/ActiveRecord/QueryMethods/rewhere) and [reorder](https://apidock.com/rails/ActiveRecord/QueryMethods/reorder), which have many use-cases.
10. [Managing Z-Index In A Component-Based Web Application](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/04/z-index-component-based-web-application/)  
    **Pavel Pomerantsev**  
    Having many definitions of `z-index` on your application CSS can create a big mess. Maybe you think that if you have two elements that have different values of `z-index`, the one with the bigger value will always appear above the other one. Pavel explains why it is not true, describes the meaning of [the stacking context](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Positioning/Understanding_z_index/The_stacking_context), and suggests how to use `z-index` property in a way it will be easy to maintain.
