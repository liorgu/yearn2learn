Vue is being used far less than the popular web frameworks, but it is placed second as a loved and wanted web framework.

   **Mark Erikson**  
   A new major version of `react-redux` was published. Mark, a dominant maintainer of this library, is giving a brief on the changes of this version. The underground big change is the implementation of the `connect` API by React hooks. This version is supposed to have a significant performance improvement over the previous version, and has a new useful API - `batch`. When multiple dispatches will be wrapped by `batch`, they will trigger only a single render.

   **Vitali Zaidman**  
   If you are an experienced React developer, you may remember the popular library [why-did-you-update](https://www.npmjs.com/package/why-did-you-update), which helps you to know where you have redundant renders. Unfortunately, this library is no longer maintained. However, a relatively new promising library, [why-did-you-render](https://github.com/welldone-software/why-did-you-render) came to fill the void. Vitaly, who built this tool, explains how it can be used for detecting redundant renders of functional components which include hooks.
10. [React Universal Routing](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/react-universal-routing-94215253d9)  
    **Michał Skoczylas**  
    When you design a web application, you have many architectural decisions to make - SPA(single page application) or not? SSR(server-side rendering) or client-side rendering, how to fetch and display the received data? Michał introduces some naive solutions and suggests a double routing approach, when fetching data on the client-side is done separately from the React components, according to the current route.
