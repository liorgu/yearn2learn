1. [Application State Management with React](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/application-state-management-with-react)  
   **Kent C. Dodds**  
   State management in React application is mostly done by external libraries like Redux. Kent suggests using React itself for state management, using context. In this way, you still solve the prop-drilling issue and instead of one global store, you have multiple stores which each one of them is scoped to where it is needed.

The article of Gergely explains what are design systems, suggests when to use them and represents some examples.
