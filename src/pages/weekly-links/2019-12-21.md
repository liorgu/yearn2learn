**Top 10 Links For 13-19/12**

1. [The State of JavaScript 2019](https://2019.stateofjs.com/)  
   **Sacha Greif**  
   The results of the state of JavaScript 2019 are in! The results are pretty predictable - React.js, Jest and Visual Studio Code are among the winners in different categories. It was interesting to see the jump in the percentage of people that used Apollo and will use it again(from 11% last year to 25% this year), the winning of GraphQL as the technology with the highest interest and as second-best technology with the highest satisfaction. Also, little surprising for me was that 89% of the participants already used `async-await` that was released in 2017.
