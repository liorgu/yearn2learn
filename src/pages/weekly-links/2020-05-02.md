   **Nik Graf**  
   Nik explains how to use the key attribute for remounting a React component. From my own experience, it feels like a hack, but as Nik wrote, it is a weapon for overcoming a tight deadline.
2. [Storage for the web](https://web.dev/storage-for-the-web/)

   Pete compares several storage techniques in the browser. I learned from this article about the quota limits and the `StorageManager` API.

   Joseph recommends using the "approximately correct" approach. He suggests three ways of adopting thinking in approximations and not looking for certainties.

   **Balthazar Rouberol**  
   Balthazar brought up a lot of shell productivity tips. I will surely try to use most of the keyboard shortcuts which are mentioned in the article. Just need to be aware that not all of them are working in all the terminal tools, but you may configure them.

   Geoff represents a new version of [Code Time](https://www.software.com/code-time) tool for tracking times of coding. I used the [WakaTime](https://wakatime.com/) extension in Visual Studio Code before, and it may be interesting to compare between the two.
9. [Performance Optimization in React Context](https://saul-mirone.github.io/performance-optimization-in-react-context/)
