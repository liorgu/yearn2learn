## Personal

- **[Avoiding large list of parameters in a JavaScript function]**  
   Last week I had to refactor functions and add arguments for them. When you have more than 2 arguments in a function, you may find yourself calling them like

  ```
  myFunc('a', null, 1, true)
  ```

  There are a lot of problems in this example like:

  1. Visual - it is ugly to put null parameters when you call a function
  2. Readability - it is not obvious what each parameter means
  3. Maintenance - it is hard to refactor if you want to add arguments and/or change their order.

  Therefore, the concept of a single object argument is very appealing and [this article](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/always-pass-one-argument-to-your-javascript-function-4140d909937e) expresses it, although a bit radical.

- **Avoiding large list of props in a React component**  
  I like to write generic React components, which you can use for any need and open for design changes.
  In the past, I thought that it will require more props, but today I understand that a large list of props is a maintenance disaster.  
  What can we do instead? There are a lot of options for inversion of control:

  1. [Render props](https://reactjs.org/docs/render-props.html)
  2. [Compound components](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEGg-3pIHlE)
  3. [State reducer](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/the-state-reducer-pattern-with-react-hooks)

  These are just a part of the patterns that have to be weapons on your toolbox when writing common components.

- **Filtering falsy values from array in JavaScript**  
  How do you remove falsy values from array in JavaScript?  
  This simple task has several solutions.  
  One answer is use third-party library like [Lodash's compact](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#compact).  
  But you can do it easily without third parties with
  ```
  anArray.filter(element => !!element)
  ```
  You can even do it more clean with
  ```
  anArray.filter(Boolean)
  ```
  Yes, [you can also you use `Boolean` as a function](https://davidwalsh.name/array-boolean). The last line is equivalent to
  ```
  anArray.filter(element => Boolean(element))
  ```
