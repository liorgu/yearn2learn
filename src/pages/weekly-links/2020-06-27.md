## Articles

- **[Styling Layout Wrappers In CSS](https://ishadeed.com/article/styling-wrappers-css/)**  
  Things to notice:
  - There is a `aside` HTML element.
  - Single responsibility - add more HTML elements if your current element has several roles.
  - Avoid shorthand properties that may override longhand properties.
  - Using `!important` is good for utility classes.
  - `display: contents;` removes the box of the element from the CSS flow.

* **[An in-depth beginner's guide to testing React applications](https://jkettmann.com/beginners-guide-to-testing-react/)**  
  Things to notice:

  - It is better to write tests from the user perspective, and not check implementation details.
  - You can use the `screen.debug` API, with or without parameter to print to the console the whole HTML that is currently rendered or the HTML of a specific element.
  - There are a lot of query APIs that you can use, but `getByRole` is the favored one. You can know the role by [this table](https://github.com/A11yance/aria-query#elements-to-roles). You can specify a `name` parameter which contains the text of the element.
  - If there is no role(div for example), you can use `getByText`.
  - It is recommended to use the [`user-event` library](https://github.com/testing-library/user-event) for simulating real user events.
  - You should use the `getBy` queries when the element to search should be seen right away on the render, and `findBy` queries when the element should be seen asynchronously.

- **[An Overview of Scroll Technologies](https://css-tricks.com/an-overview-of-scroll-technologies/)**  
  Things to notice:

  - When a scrolling is executed, you may want a certain behavior. For example, sticky elements([`position: sticky`](https://css-tricks.com/creating-sliding-effects-using-sticky-positioning/)), move elements in a different speed([parallex](https://alligator.io/css/pure-css-parallax/)), and snapping to a specific scroll position([`scroll-snap`](https://css-tricks.com/practical-css-scroll-snapping/))
  - Different techniques for listening to scroll: `IntersectionObserver` API and the `onScroll` event.
  - Scrolling libraries: [ScrollMagic](https://github.com/janpaepke/ScrollMagic), [ScrollScene](https://github.com/jonkwheeler/ScrollScene)(a wrapper of ScrollMagic) and [ScrollTrigger](https://greensock.com/scrolltrigger/).

- **[Selection controls — UI component series](https://uxdesign.cc/selection-controls-ui-component-series-3badc0bdb546)**  
  Things to notice:
  - There a lot of selection controls - need to carefully think when to use each one
  - Should handle states of the controls - enabled/disabled/hover/focus when they are selected or not selected.
  - A checkbox is better than a toggle when the action doesn't take effect immediately.
  - A radio button is better than a dropdown when the number of options is small.
