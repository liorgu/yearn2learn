- **[4 ways to render large lists in React](https://blog.logrocket.com/4-ways-to-render-large-lists-in-react/)**

  - There is a popular [react-paginate](https://github.com/AdeleD/react-paginate) library, in case you use pagination.
  - If you use an infinite scroll, there are a lot of libraries that support it [like this one](https://github.com/ankeetmaini/react-infinite-scroll-component).
  - In order to render large lists in an efficient way, there are [react-virtualized])(https://github.com/bvaughn/react-virtualized) and [react-window](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-window) libraries that render only the parts that are visible to the user. Both libraries were written by the same person, and `react-window` is a rewrite of `react-virtualized`.

- **[How I structure Express apps](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/how-i-structure-express-apps)**

  - This is an example of a basic structure for an Express application.
  - There is a different logic on `index.js` entry point, depends on the environment - development/production.
  - The definition of all the routes is written on a separate file and is entered into a router, while there is error middleware that handles any error that may happen in your application.

- **[What the fuck is a closure?](https://whatthefuck.is/closure)**

  - A simple explanation of the meaning of closures.
  - We can define it as the ability to access variables that were defined outside the current function.
  - You can think of closures as memories of the past function calls, because we may still access the variables after the current function has finished if there was an asynchronous operation.

- **[Protecting Your API from Brute Forcing By Rate Limiting in NodeJS](https://blog.soshace.com/protecting-your-api-from-brute-forcing-by-rate-limiting-in-nodejs/)**

  - This article explains how to prevent brute force attacks by a technique which is called rate-limiting. A part of the article repeats itself(copy-paste mistake), you can ignore it.
  - The first part is theoretical - explains what is rate-limiting, why should we use it, and two algorithms which implement it.
  - The second part is practical - shows how to implement it in NodeJs using [express-bruth](https://github.com/AdamPflug/express-brute) as a middleware which implements the rate-limiting algorithm, and [express-bruth-redis](https://github.com/AdamPflug/express-brute-redis), as a store to keep the relevant data.
