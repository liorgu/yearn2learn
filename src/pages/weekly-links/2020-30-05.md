## React

- **[RecoilJS is meant to rock your React world](https://mariosfakiolas.com/blog/recoiljs-is-meant-to-rock-your-react-world/)**  
  I believe that [Recoil](https://recoiljs.org/) is going to be the next big thing in React.  
  This is a new state management library created by Facebook. It was announced during [React Europe 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fb3cOMFkEzs). Its API is very simple, and the fact that it is coming from the same company that responsible for React, ensures that every change in React(concurrency mode) will be synchronized with it.  
  If you want to view more videos from React Europe 2020, [here is an article that summarizes all its talks](https://www.telerik.com/blogs/i-watched-all-27-react-europe-talks-so-you-dont-have-to).

* **[Five common mistakes writing react components (with hooks) in 2020](https://www.lorenzweiss.de/common_mistakes_react_hooks/)**  
  This article mentions some wrong architecture and usage of React hooks.  
  I think that single responsibility is a very important principle, especially in React components. It may help us enormously for maintaining them and writing useful tests.

- **[The ultimate roundup of React form validation solutions](https://blog.logrocket.com/the-ultimate-roundup-of-react-form-validation-solutions/)**  
  This is a comprehensive review of many form libraries that you can use in React application.  
  It is very nice to read and be exposed to different approaches to building components that are intended to do the same thing.  
  For small simple forms, I would consider using plain React without using any form libraries. Any library has its learning curve, although, for a form with a lot of fields and validations, it is a must.

## News

- **[StackOverflow 2020 Developer Survey Results](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020)**  
  StackOverflow reveals the result of its annual survey.  
  I was especially interested in the technology section. It is a bit of a shame that you cannot see a direct comparison with the results of last year, but if you want to do it yourself, [these are the results from the previous year](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019).

- **[instant.page 5.0](https://instant.page/v5)**  
   `instant.page` looks like a great tool for preloading pages in your application. It has a lot of a configuration options like:

  1.  Starting the preloading on mouse down instead of on hover
  2.  Adjusting the delay time between hovering to preloading
  3.  Doing the preloading right after the link element was entered into the viewport.

- **[Gatsby, Website-Building Startup Backed By Index Ventures, Raises \$28 Million](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidjeans/2020/05/27/gatsby-website-building-startup-backed-by-index-ventures-raises-28-million/#635f68467f3e)**  
   Gatsby is a great tool for creating React applications, especially static sites. This blog is built with Gatsby, and I enjoy using it.  
   I am happy to see the development of the product, from a small open-source library to a framework that has a lot of plugins and themes, and finally a successful startup. I truly believe in it.

## Non-Technical

- **[Habits of High-Functioning Teams](https://deniseyu.io/2020/05/23/habits-of-high-performing-teams.html)**  
  This is a good description of a couple of characteristics of healthy engineering teams.  
  I am a keen believer in generous communication and on a constant getting/delivering positive and negative feedback.

- **[Beyond Remote](https://vimota.me/writing/beyond-remote)**  
   In Covid times, most of us started to work from home.  
   This article covers some aspects of remote work:

  - Which type of companies can benefit from it
  - Different arrangements of remote working
  - What is the role of the office on such terms
  - How is it going to affect our salaries

- **[Intentional Career Building](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/intentional-career-building)**  
   Kent gives in the post some great advice on developing your personal brand.  
   I agree that the content you deliver is very important, and being consistent is one of the keys.  
   I also consider changing the day when I deliver my newsletter, as it may have more effect if I send it on Mondays.
